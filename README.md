This repository solely for reference and do not responsible for any bugs or errors you encounter.

Introduction
A reference for beginner who want to learn how to use GRPC client in Swift 5.

GRPC Server: NodeJs
GRPC Client: Swift

I reference several tutorials/guides to make this project up, so make sure you visit
1. https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift   - This site has all the guidance you need to run GRPC in your Swift Mobile APP, but their example is useless
2. https://grpc.io/docs/languages/objective-c/quickstart/   - GRPC Official guide is useful, it guide you to install essential tools to compile .proto file
3. https://github.com/cats-oss/grpc-swift-client    - This is a GRPC Swift client library, i did not use this, but it has some example that give me idea on how to make a call to Server through GRPC Client interface

Finally i hope everyone find this repository useful!
